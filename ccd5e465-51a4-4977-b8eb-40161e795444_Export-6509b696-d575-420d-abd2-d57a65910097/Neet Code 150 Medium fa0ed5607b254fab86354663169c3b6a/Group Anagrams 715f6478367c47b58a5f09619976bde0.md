# Group Anagrams

Status: Not started
Summary: The document provides a Python solution for the "Group Anagrams" problem. The solution uses a dictionary to group anagrams together by sorting each string and using it as a key. The time complexity of the solution is O(n * k log k), where n is the number of strings and k is the maximum length of a string.

```python
class Solution:
    def groupAnagrams(self, strs: List[str]) -> List[List[str]]:
        lookup = {}
        for i in strs:
            j = "".join(sorted(i))
            if j in lookup:
                lookup[j].append(i)
            else:
                lookup[j] = [i]
        return [lookup[i] for i in lookup]
