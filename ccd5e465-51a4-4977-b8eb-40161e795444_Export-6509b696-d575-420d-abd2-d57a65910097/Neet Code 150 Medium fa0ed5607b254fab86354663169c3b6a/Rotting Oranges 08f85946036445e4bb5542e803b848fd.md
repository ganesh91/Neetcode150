[https://leetcode.com/problems/rotting-oranges/description/](https://leetcode.com/problems/rotting-oranges/description/)

Idea:

- Similar to Bi-Directional BFS
- Add all rotten in one place and keep it going till the queue is exhsuated

```python
from collections import deque
class Solution:
    def orangesRotting(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        rows = len(grid)
        columns = len(grid[0])

        fresh_oranges = 0
        rotten_oranges = 0

        q = deque([])

        for i in range(rows):
            for j in range(columns):
                if grid[i][j] == 1:
                    fresh_oranges += 1
                if grid[i][j] == 2:
                    rotten_oranges += 1
                    q.append((i,j))
        
        minutes = -1
        
        while q:
            entries = len(q)
            minutes += 1
            while entries:
                entries -= 1
                i,j = q.popleft()
                for a,b in [(0,-1), (-1,0), (1,0), (0,1)]:
                    x = a+i
                    y = b+j
                    if 0 <= x < rows and 0 <= y < columns and grid[x][y] == 1:
                        fresh_oranges -= 1
                        grid[x][y] = 0
                        q.append((x,y))
        
        return -1 if fresh_oranges > 0 else max(0,minutes)
```
