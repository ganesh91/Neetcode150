[https://leetcode.com/problems/jump-game/](https://leetcode.com/problems/jump-game/)

```python
class Solution:
    def canJump(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:
        max_travel_distance = nums[0]
        travelled_distance = 0
        while travelled_distance < len(nums) and travelled_distance <= max_travel_distance:
            max_travel_distance = max(max_travel_distance, travelled_distance+nums[travelled_distance])
            travelled_distance += 1
        return max_travel_distance >= len(nums)-1
```

Idea:

- We start sweeping the array for max index
- If first array can travel 5, end can travel 2, the maximum we can reach from 2 is still 5. Thats the idea and we keep progressing
- If we cannot reach the destination, then cannot jump
