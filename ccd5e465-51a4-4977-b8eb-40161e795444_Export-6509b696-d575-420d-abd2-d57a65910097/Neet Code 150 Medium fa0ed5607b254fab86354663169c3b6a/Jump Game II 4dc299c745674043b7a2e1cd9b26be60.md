```python
class Solution:
    def jump(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        if len(nums) == 1:
            return 0
        distances = [float('inf') for i in range(len(nums))]
        distances[-1] = 0
        for i in range(len(distances)-2,-1,-1):
            min_jumps = float('inf')
            for j in range(1, nums[i]+1):
                if i+j >= len(nums)-1:
                    min_jumps = 1
                    break
                else:
                    min_jumps = min(min_jumps, distances[i+j]+1)
            distances[i] = min_jumps
        return distances[0]
```

Dynamic programming:

- Cost to visit last index = 0
- Any jump to last index from any of the previous index  = 1
- If not, cost = min(jumps from jumpable index) + 1
-
