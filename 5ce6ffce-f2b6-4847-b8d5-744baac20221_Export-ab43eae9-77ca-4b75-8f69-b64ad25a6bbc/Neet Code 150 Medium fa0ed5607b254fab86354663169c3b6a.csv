Not started,Copy List with Random Pointer,Linked List,"The ""Copy List with Random Pointer"" problem involves creating a deep copy of a linked list with random pointers. The solution suggests iterating through the list twice, first to copy the main list and create a lookup for the new nodes, and then to fill in the random pointers using the lookup. The provided Python code implements this solution.",,,,"November 23, 2023 1:48 PM"
Not started,Combination Sum II,BackTracking,"The ""Combination Sum II"" problem involves finding unique combinations of numbers from a given list that sum up to a target value. The provided Python solution uses recursion and backtracking to generate the combinations, while avoiding duplicates by checking for consecutive identical elements in the list.",,,,"November 23, 2023 3:24 PM"
Not started,Subsets,BackTracking,"The document provides a Python solution to the ""Subsets"" problem on LeetCode. The solution uses backtracking to generate all possible subsets of a given list of numbers.",,,,"November 23, 2023 3:46 PM"
Not started,Design Add and Search Words Data Structure,Trie,"The ""Design Add and Search Words Data Structure"" document provides a Python implementation of a WordDictionary class using a Trie data structure. The addWord() method adds a word to the Trie, while the search() method searches for a word in the Trie, allowing wildcard characters. The idea is to recursively traverse the Trie based on the characters in the word, considering wildcard characters as well.",,,,"November 23, 2023 3:48 PM"
Not started,Add Two Numbers,Linked List,"The document provides a Python solution for the ""Add Two Numbers"" problem on LeetCode. The solution uses a singly-linked list to represent the numbers and adds them digit by digit, considering carry values. The solution is implemented in the addTwoNumbers method of the Solution class.",,,,"November 23, 2023 4:00 PM"
Not started,Evaluate Reverse Polish Notation,Stack,The document provides a Python solution to evaluate Reverse Polish Notation (RPN). It uses a stack to perform the evaluation and includes a division function to handle negative numbers correctly. The solution is based on a problem from LeetCode.,,,,"November 23, 2023 4:30 PM"
Not started,Maximum Product Subarray,Greedy,"The ""Maximum Product Subarray"" problem can be solved using a modified version of the Kadane's algorithm. By keeping track of both the maximum and minimum product so far, we can handle negative numbers. The provided Python solution implements this algorithm to find the maximum product subarray.",,,,"November 24, 2023 9:16 AM"
Not started,Maximum Subarray,Greedy,"The maximum subarray problem is solved using a dynamic programming approach. The algorithm iterates through the array, keeping track of the maximum sum encountered so far and the current sum. If the current sum plus the current element is less than the current element, it marks an inflection point and starts a new subarray. The algorithm returns the maximum sum encountered.",,,,"November 24, 2023 9:21 AM"
Not started,Number of Connected Components in Graph,"DFS, UnionFind","This document discusses two variants for finding the number of connected components in an undirected graph. Variant 1 uses a typical DFS approach, while Variant 2 utilizes the Union Find algorithm. Both variants provide solutions to the problem.",,,,"November 24, 2023 9:54 AM"
Not started,Merge Triplets to Form Target Triplet,Greedy,"The ""Merge Triplets to Form Target Triplet"" problem is solved using a Python solution. The idea is to iterate through the triplets, remove rows that do not have values greater than the corresponding target values, and find the maximum values for each element. If the maximum values match the target triplet, return True; otherwise, return False.",,,,"November 24, 2023 11:00 AM"
Not started,Two Sum II,"Binary Search, Hash Map","The document provides a Python solution for the problem ""Two Sum II"" on LeetCode. The solution uses a binary search algorithm to find the indices of two numbers in a sorted array that add up to a given target.",,,,"November 24, 2023 11:00 AM"
Not started,Pacific Atlantic Waterflow,DFS,The document provides a Python solution for the problem of determining the cells in a matrix that can flow to both the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. The solution uses a recursive approach to mark the cells and returns the coordinates of the marked cells.,,,,"November 24, 2023 11:01 AM"
Not started,Koko Eating Bananas,Binary Search,"The ""Koko Eating Bananas"" problem on LeetCode is solved using binary search on the k-space. The provided Python code implements the solution, where the minimum eating speed is determined by iterating through the piles and checking if the total time is less than or equal to the given hours.",,,,"November 24, 2023 11:01 AM"
Not started,Valid SudoKU,Array,"The provided code is a Python solution to the problem ""Valid Sudoku"" on LeetCode. The code checks if a given Sudoku board is valid by ensuring that each row, column, and 3x3 sub-grid contains unique numbers from 1 to 9. The code uses lookup dictionaries to keep track of numbers in each row, column, and sub-grid, and returns True if the board is valid and False otherwise.",,,,"November 24, 2023 11:01 AM"
Not started,Clone Graph,"DFS, Hash Map","The ""Clone Graph"" problem on LeetCode involves cloning a graph represented by a Node class. The given solution uses depth-first search (DFS) to recursively clone the graph. It maintains a node_lookup dictionary to keep track of cloned nodes and a visited set to avoid duplicate cloning. The solution returns the cloned node corresponding to the input node.",,,,"November 24, 2023 5:26 PM"
